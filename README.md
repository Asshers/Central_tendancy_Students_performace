# Central_tendancy_Students_performace

**Description:**

The "Central_tendency_Students_performace" dataset contains information about students' performance in a test. The dataset includes the number of male and female participants, the parental level of education, and their average scores in math, reading, and writing. 

The analysis will focus on calculating the central tendency measures, such as mean, median, and mode, to understand the typical or central performance of the students in each subject.

Additionally, scoring variation will be examined to identify the spread or dispersion of scores around the central tendency. This will help in understanding the distribution of scores and identifying any potential outliers or extreme values.


1. **Calculate the Math Score Threshold:** Firstly, I will determine the minimum math score required to be in the top 25% of students. This will be done by finding the 75th percentile of math scores, which separates the top-performing students from the rest.

2. **Identify Top-Performing Students:** Next, I will filter the dataset to identify students whose math scores are above the calculated threshold. These students will be considered as the top 25% in terms of math performance.

3. **Assign Bonus Points:** To incentivize and recognize the achievements of the top-performing students, I will work with the management to decide the number of bonus points to be awarded. The bonus points can be added directly to the math scores of these students.

4. **Communication and Implementation:** Once the bonus points are determined, I will assist the management in communicating the decision to the students and ensuring that the bonus points are accurately added to their math scores in the dataset.

By following these steps, the management can easily identify and reward the top-performing students, encouraging and motivating them to excel further in their academic endeavors.
